# AuthMantle SSO
AuthMantle SSO is a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution that allows users to authenticate and authorize
themselves across multiple applications (that should be configured?).
AuthMantle SSO is built on top of the OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 protocol and provides a
secure and easy-to-use authentication mechanism for web and mobile applications.

Written in Go using HTML templates for the frontend.
